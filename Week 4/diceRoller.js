/*
 * This file will have functions that can roll a die and display the result to a canvas element.
 * We will make the functions as a group exercise, then you will add the two pieces below:
 * 1. Add a third die
 * 2. Make a win happen on any pair, and a super win happen on 3 of a kind. A super win can just be a different message being displayed.
 * 
 * Feel free to add any extras you may like to make this fancy.
